# ARIA Benchmarks (AI Research Intelligence Assessment)

ARIA Benchmarks is a comprehensive suite of closed-book tests designed to assess an AI model's knowledge and understanding of machine learning research, methodologies, and state-of-the-art developments.

## Overview

The ARIA Benchmarks evaluate various aspects of AI research knowledge, including:

1. Metrics Knowledge
2. Paper Abstract Generation
3. Model Description
4. Research Area Classification
5. Model Comparison (Odd-Man-Out)
6. Similar Model Identification
7. Top Model Recognition
8. Dataset Description
9. Dataset Modality Classification

These benchmarks are derived from the Papers With Code dataset, ensuring they reflect current trends and developments in AI research.

## Benchmark Types

### 1. Metrics Knowledge
Tests the model's ability to identify appropriate metrics for specific models and datasets.

### 2. Paper Abstract Generation
Assesses the model's capability to generate plausible abstracts given paper titles.

### 3. Model Description
Evaluates the model's understanding of various AI models by asking for descriptions.

### 4. Research Area Classification
Tests the model's ability to classify AI models into appropriate research areas.

### 5. Model Comparison (Odd-Man-Out)
Assesses the model's understanding of model similarities and differences.

### 6. Similar Model Identification
Tests the model's knowledge of models that are similar or often compared.

### 7. Top Model Recognition
Evaluates the model's awareness of top-performing models for various benchmarks.

### 8. Dataset Description
Assesses the model's knowledge of common datasets in AI research.

### 9. Dataset Modality Classification
Tests the model's ability to identify the modalities of different datasets.

## Benchmark Format

Each benchmark in the ARIA suite is provided in JSONL format, with each entry containing:

- `input`: A prompt or question about AI research
- `ideal`: The expected response or answer

## Usage

These benchmarks can be used to:

1. Evaluate the AI research knowledge of large language models
2. Assess the effectiveness of AI education and training programs
3. Identify gaps in an AI system's understanding of machine learning concepts
4. Compare different AI models' grasp of current research trends

## Data Source

The ARIA Benchmarks are created using data from Papers With Code, a free and open resource for machine learning papers, code, and evaluation tables.
